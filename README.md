# CompreSS

🗜️ PHP script to compress CSS

Used, many moons ago, for an online CSS compression tool, the script has been saved and now made available for public use. 

Open source, available under the GNU v2 license. 

Expect further notes and content to be uploaded over the coming months.

If you have any thoughts on good compression techniques, please let me know.

## Instructions for use

The script function is named `compress_css` and has just one parameter - the CSS script that you wish to compress. It will return the compressed CSS.

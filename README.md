Used, many moons ago, for an online CSS compression tool, the script has been saved and now made available for public use. 

Open source, available under the GNU v2 license. 

Expect further notes and content to be uploaded over the coming months.

If you have any thoughts on good compression techniques, please let me know.

Please see the FAQ for [the changelog](https://github.com/dartiss/CSSquish/wiki/Changelog).

## Instructions for use

The script function is named `cssquish` and has just one parameter required - a string containing the CSS that you wish to compress. It will return the compressed CSS.
